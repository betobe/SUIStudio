# SUI-Autocompleted

React component that shows a list of suggestions under an input file when you start to write something.
It's based on the container component design ( [more info](https://medium.com/@learnreact/container-components-c0e67432e005) ).


## Demo page

- Checkout a Sui-Autocompleted component demo [here](http://sui-components.github.io/sui-autocompleted/).
 <br /> or...
- Clone the repo and open `index.html` file inside `docs` folder


## Usage

```
import 'babel/polyfill';
import React from 'react';
import ReactDom from 'react-dom';
import AutocompletedContainer from './autocompleted-container';
import AutocompletedGithubUserContainer from './autocompleted-githubUsers-container';
import AutocompletedComponentContainer from './autocompleted-component-container';
import './style.scss';
import '../src/index.scss';

ReactDom.render(<AutocompletedContainer />, document.getElementById('languages'));
ReactDom.render(<AutocompletedGithubUserContainer />, document.getElementById('github-users'));
ReactDom.render(<AutocompletedComponentContainer />, document.getElementById('component-container'));
```


## Component Properties

The component exposes the following props:

* placeholder (String): **Optional** Default text value for the input file when no key is pressed (placeholder value).
* suggests (Array): **Required** Array of SuggestionObjects. Te array contains the suggestions to show. If you don't want to show anything you have to send an empty array.
* handleChange (Function): **Required** This function is called everytime user change the input field value.

	```javascript
		const handleChange = function( inputFileValue ){ ... }
	```
* handleSelect (Function): **Required** This function is called when one suggestion is selected (via click or enter pressed).

	```javascript
		const handleSelect = function( suggestionValue ){ ... }
	```

and then you have to create containers which one setting that properties in the sui-autocompleted component. You can view an example of this kind of container in the [doc folder](https://github.com/scm-spain/sui-autocompleted/blob/master/docs/autocompleted-container.jsx).

### SuggestObject

An SuggestObject is a plain JS Object with these specials keys:

```javascript
{
    'id': [Unique id for the suggestion],
    'value': [value to be passed to the handleSelect callback function]
    'content': [React Component] or [Text to be show in the UI]
    'literal': [String] This key is REQUIRED only if you are using a ReactJS Component like a content. It is used to decide which text has to be put in the input text when this suggestion is selected, in other case content will be used,    
}
```

### Theme

There are several classes in order to apply a theme to the component:

* sui-autocompleted
* sui-autocompleted-input
* sui-autocompleted-clear
* sui-autocompleted-results
* sui-autocompleted-item
* sui-autocompleted-item--active

The component exports a basic CSS that you can include from the package in the node_modules.


## Installation

To run the component and play with the examples you have to:

### Download files from GitHub repo.

* `$ git clone https://github.com/scm-spain/sui-autocompleted`
* `$ cd sui-autocompleted`

### Install dependencies.

* `$ npm install` // Install npm dependencies from package.json

### Launch the development environment.

* `$ npm run dev` // Run development environment
*  Go to _localhost:8080_


## Bundle

In order to generate the bundle including all React dependencies and the component logic we need to bundle a single JS file running the following command:
```
$ npm run build
```


## JS Testing

Execute a complete test by running:

```
There are two options for executing tests:

* Single mode: `$ npm test`
* Watch mode: `$ npm run test:watch`


## Lint Testing

```
In addition, you can run specific test for linting JS and SASS:
SASS: (SASS linting rules specified in file `.scss-lint.yml`)

```
$ npm run lint:sass
```


## NPM

The SUI-Autocompleted component is available as a NPM package [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@schibstedspain/sui-autocompleted):

```
npm install @schibstedspain/sui-autocompleted`
```

## Environment Dependencies

To run the lint tasks we have dependencies of:

* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)
* [scss-lint](https://github.com/brigade/scss-lint)

If that tools are not installed you cant commit. Because the lint pass never will be ok.
